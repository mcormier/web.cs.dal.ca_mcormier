<B>Description</B>
<BR>

<p>Dalhousie University hosts many foreign exchange students, and the Computer Science
faculty contains an above average amount of exchange students.  Because of
the high demand for ESL instruction in the Computer Science faculty, a peer ESL
tutoring program was established.
</p>

<p>I volunteered to be an ESL tutor and was assigned two student peers, 
both studying at the graduate level.  Instruction included a group meeting (once a
week), and an individual meeting with each student (also once a week).  Group meetings were
formatted to provide english social interaction in a relaxed setting, usually with the use of 
games.  Individual meetings concentrated on pronounciation and comprehension (reading 
newspapers, tongue twisters).

Having been through a French immersion program and previous experience as an exchange student 
helped me to empathize with ESL students. I greatly enjoyed this work and plan to do similar
work in the future.

<B>Description</B>
<BR>
<p>
Traditionally there is a high failure rate for first year computer programming
classes.  
To combat that high failure rate, 
help new computer users become familiar with the local computing environment 
and overcome common programming stumbling blocks,
a <a href="http://www.cs.dal.ca/studentservices/learning.shtml" target="_blank">Learning Centre</a>
was established. 
</p><p>
Since other faculties may provide the choice of either calculus 
or computer programming as a degree requirement,
there is an eclectic mix of people with varying familiarity and goals in the first
year classes.  Regularly helping a broad spectrum of people with rudimentary to complex
problems was enjoyable; teaching students (who are under pressure) concepts instead of 
handing them answers was challenging.

<p> The Learning Centre commonly provides help for 1st and 2nd year undergraduates but is
open to anyone who has a problem and asks for help. I worked at the Learning Centre for two consecutive 
semesters and aided students with a wide range of problems and technologies including: Java, C, 
Assembly Language, data structures, Javascript, HTML, C++, Unix, SQL.
